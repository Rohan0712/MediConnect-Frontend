      The Internet, which became widely and easily accessible, is a powerful tool that provides countless benefits to society. Purchasing prescription drugs online is effortless and affordable â€” particularly for busy persons and the elderly, disabled, and home-bound patients. </p>

Online pharmacies will play a role in future medicines provision, and they may be able to give cognitive services through incorporating different forms of technology to expand and improve their site's operation, such as video streaming services on health concerns or medical recommendations, as well as text reminders for buying repeat prescriptions. However, be aware of illegal websites that are not licensed by Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities because they may offer counterfeit medicines and may result in serious health risks.
